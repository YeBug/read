Title：A challenging signal processing technology for biometric identification

gait versus other biometric traits:
Advantage:gait is unobtrusiveness;  can be captured at a distance
don't need physical contact;  difficult to hide or fake
Disadvantage：rely on a video sequence taken in controlled or uncontrolled environments
hard to capture the critical biometric parameters
gait changes over time
affected by clothes,footwear,walking surface,walking speed and emotional conditioin

results indicate that there is much value in combining gait with other biometrics eg.(face or foot pressure)

Generic gait recongnitioin system:
1.background subtraction  2.feature extraction  3.compare with database to recognize
