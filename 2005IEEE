Title：A challenging signal processing technology for biometric identification

gait versus other biometric traits:
Advantage:gait is unobtrusiveness;  can be captured at a distance
don't need physical contact;  difficult to hide or fake
Disadvantage：rely on a video sequence taken in controlled or uncontrolled environments
hard to capture the critical biometric parameters
gait changes over time
affected by clothes,footwear,walking surface,walking speed and emotional conditioin

results indicate that there is much value in combining gait with other biometrics eg.(face or foot pressure)

Generic gait recongnitioin system:
1.background subtraction  2.feature extraction  3.compare with database to recognize

silhouettes extracted by using model-based method have fewer noise pixels and missing parts.

gait cycle detection:
1.线性预测的方法将正弦信号拟合到噪声提取信号中，这种方法易用于循环分区。
2.采用前景总和信号的自相关来计算步行周期，计算总和信号的最优滤波系数

model-based approaches:
优势：测试序列与参考序列差异大
缺陷：依赖于在步态序列中识别特定的步态参数，通常需要高质量的步态序列。
      参数依赖度高，自我遮挡使得参数获取更困难
